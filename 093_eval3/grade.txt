> One day, a strange old wizard comes to your village and tells you that

> 
> The wizard tells you: "It is up to you, hero, to stop this dragon. Nobody

> 
> The wizard offers you a choice of one of three magic items to help you on
> your quest. 
> 
> The first is a magic whistle that lets you make any bird call that you
> want. The second is a pair of magic shoes that let you jump 10 feet in the

> into it, and turn it into perfectly cooked toast (optionally with butter

> 
> "Choose wisely, for your quest and your village depend on you."
> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Choose the magic whistle.
>  2. Choose the magic shoes.
>  3. Choose the magic toaster.
> As you take the magic whistle from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a

> school, it was that testing is VERY important). 
>

> 
> Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or

> 
> Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,

> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Go to Denevieve for help.
>  2. Go to Grew for help.
>  3. Go alone.
> After thinking about it a bit, you decide that Denevieve is probably a

> through that day of Magical Creature Biology class. 
> 
> After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
> threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
> tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
> trusted with a quest about dragons.
> 
> The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
> take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
> list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon. 
> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Silent Night, accompanied by raven calls
>  2. Angels We Have Heard on High, accompanied by roosters crowing
>  3. Bohemian Rhapsody, accompanied by the magestic call of a bald eagle
> You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing
> 
> "Si--iii-lent niiight" (CAW CAW CAW)
> "Ho--oly night" (CAW CAW).
> "Aaaalll iiss calm aaaalll is bright" (CAW CAW).
